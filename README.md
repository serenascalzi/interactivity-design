# Interactivity Design

## Design Elements
- Pagination: This design includes the Universal Principles of Design that correspond to learning. The content is divided among four pages, making it easier to process and recall.
- Navigation: Users of this design are able to navigate between pages using the page buttons at the bottom of the screen. The current page remains highlighted to indicate users’ location within the design.
- Comprehension Wizard: When a user clicks on a principle, its definition and corresponding textbook pages are displayed on the screen. Users who do not have a copy of the textbook can order one using the sidebar link.

## Norman’s Considerations
- Knowledge in the Head/World: Although this design presents information regarding Universal Principles of Design, it also includes page numbers from the textbook for additional information. The design acts as a reference from which users can access this information, rather than having to recall it.
- Simplified Structure of Tasks: The buttons and links in this design dictate the tasks that users are able to perform. These tasks are communicated to users through text and hover effects.
- Mappings: The page includes definitions and page numbers displayed in close proximity to the linked text to which they correspond. Navigational buttons, which highlight users’ current location, follow the glossary items.
- Constraints: The navigational buttons constrain users’ movement among pages. The links throughout the pages constrain the tasks and information available to users.
- Error Design: This design is responsive — it is optimized to function and display properly across devices. It also includes a link that generates an email for error reporting.
