						<h2>Universal Principles of Design</h2>
						<p>Sound design is not only within the reach of a small set of uniquely talented individuals, but can be achieved by virtually all designers. The use of well-established design principles increases the probability that a design will be successful. Use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592535879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Universal Principles of Design</em></a> as a resource to increase your cross-disciplinary knowledge and understanding of design, promote brainstorming and idea generation for design problems, and refresh your memory of design principles that are infrequently applied. Finally, use it as a means of checking the quality of your design process and product.</p>
						<p>These principles address the question &ldquo;How can I help people learn from a design?&ldquo; Click each principle for a definition and page reference.</p>
